# todo-app
This is a project built in angular to manage todo lists. 

# Build process
Builds should be done using the npm scripts to appropriately set environment variables. Builds not done this way will default to development settings. 
Configuration of variables needed for production v. deployment, like deployment urls, is handled through the npmrc file.
